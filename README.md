### This repository contains code for the UQ EdX course on fractals.

## Chaos Game Implementation
1.Define a polygon and determine its vertices.

2.Randomly choose an initial point inside the polygon.

3.In each iteration, randomly select one vertex of the polygon.

4.Move the current point to the midpoint between the current point and the selected vertex.

5.Repeat 

After many iterations, the points will converge to a fractal pattern.

### Using PyTorch in the Chaos Game

* **Vectorized processing**: The code does not use a for loop to compute each point individually; instead, it processes a tensor containing NUM_POINTS points all at once.

* **Tensor operations**: The core computation points = (points + chosen_vertices) / 2.0 is a vectorized operation, which PyTorch can distribute across multiple GPU cores for parallel execution.

* **GPU acceleration**: All computations are performed on the GPU, significantly reducing computation time.

**Analysis**: 
The code uses PyTorch's tensor operations to efficiently compute the points of the fractal, leveraging GPU acceleration for performance.
The fractal dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is log(3)/log(2), approximately 1.585. By analyzing the generated pattern, we can see that it has a self-similar structure, where each smaller triangle resembles the overall shape.

**Prompt**:

promopt word:"why shows this error when i pull the request to github"

model answer:"The error message indicates that the commit history of the local branch is behind the remote branch. This means that there are changes in the remote repository that are not present in your local repository. To resolve this, you need to update your local branch with the latest changes from the remote branch before pushing your changes."

my edit: download the  git for windows and install it, then use the git bash to pull the request to github. 

prompt word:"why show  Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations when git push to github"

model answer:"The error message indicates that the authentication method used for Git operations is not supported. GitHub has deprecated password authentication for Git operations, and now requires a personal access token (PAT) or SSH key for authentication. To resolve this, you need to create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings and use it instead of your password when prompted during Git operations."

my edit: create a personal access token in my GitHub account settings and use it instead of your password when prompted during Git operations.
